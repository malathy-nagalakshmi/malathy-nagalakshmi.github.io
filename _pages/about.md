I currently work at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer. I graduated from [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) with a Master's degree in Computer and Information Science in May 2023. During my time here, I got an opportunity to work with [Prof. Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/) and [Dr. Lara Martin](https://laramartin.net/). My research interests lie in the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science with a flavor of Psychology.

Previously, I had an opportunity to collaborate with [Dr. Raghavan Komondoor](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~raghavan/) and [Dr. Raveendra Kumar Medicherla](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=S9gOtwkAAAAJ&hl=en) from [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/). Prior to this, I pursued my Bachelorâ€™s in Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering at  [PES University](https://cs.pes.edu/) and graduated in 2019.
