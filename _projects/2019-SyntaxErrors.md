title: "Framework for Automatic Detection Of Syntax Errors "
collection: projects
excerpt: "Programmers spend a lot of their time on syntax error corrections. There is no universal tool that emits helpful descriptive error messages for all languages. We built a
flexible language-agnostic framework that identifies errors in a program and improves
incomprehensible error messages emitted by a compiler/interpreter using Python Lex
and Yacc (PLY)."
