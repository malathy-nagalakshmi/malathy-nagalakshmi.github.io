Swapped faces between videos without the emotion of the target face seeping through. We were able to detect facial landmarks in videos even when the subjects were in motion. This involved performing facial landmark detection, stabilization using histogram equalization, Delaunay Triangulation to control the warping and seamless blending to get visually pleasing results.
