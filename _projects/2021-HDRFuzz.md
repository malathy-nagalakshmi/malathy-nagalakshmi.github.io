Buffer overruns are a prevalent vulnerability in software libraries and applications.
We improved the performance of AFL, an open-source vulnerability detection tool, by
using a novel fitness metric to detect buffer overflows. We detected 20 vulnerabilities
within 200 seconds with the MIT and Google Fuzzer Test Suite benchmarks compared
to baseline AFL which detects 7.
