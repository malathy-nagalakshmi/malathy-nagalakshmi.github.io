Research in the realm of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) often overlooks the needs and experiences of autistic adults. We interviewed 12 autistic adults and performed thematic analysis on the interview transcripts to understand the pain points of the AAC applications used and determine what technological advances they might find helpful. We address the following research questions: a)  What are the benefits and challenges that autistic AAC users run into when using existing AAC applications? b) How do participants feel about NLP techniques being integrated into their AAC apps? c) What types of features do autistic adults require or prefer to see from AAC applications?
