Research in the realm of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) often
overlooks the needs and experiences of autistic adults. We interviewed 12 autistic adults
and performed thematic analysis on the interview transcripts to understand the pain
points of the AAC applications used. With the feedback received and by incorporating
NLP techniques we implemented a prototype using Coughdrop, an open-source AAC
application.
