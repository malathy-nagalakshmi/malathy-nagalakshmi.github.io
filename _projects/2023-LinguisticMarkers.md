Our understanding of how language affects first impressions is limited. To gain insights
into the formation of these impressions, we studied warmth and competence. We performed linguistic analysis
on the Candor Corpus (Large Multimodal corpus of Human Speech) to identify key
features such as style, emotion, and empathy that affect the perception of warmth
and competence.
